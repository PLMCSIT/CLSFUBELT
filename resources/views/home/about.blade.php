                    <h3>About: Christ, The Living Stone Fellowship</h3>
                    <p>
                         From its humble beginnings as a campus ministry in the 70â€™s, otherwise known as the Jesus People Movement, Christ, the Living Stone Fellowship blossomed into a nationwide ministry with more than 100 daughter churches throughout the Philippine archipelago. And in recent years, it initiated significant efforts to reach out several parts of Asia and North America. Hence, for the more than two decades since it became a formal church 
                         organization, CLSF had not only experienced tremendous church and ministerial growth but also found its right place in the Body of Christ. And as the country is facing the most challenging period of its entire existence, CLSF, through its newly-commissioned Justice, Faith, and Mercy ministries, is more than ready to stand in the gap.

                    <h3>How We Started</h3>
                    <p>
                        Christ, the Living Stone Fellowship (CLSF) traces its beginnings in the turbulent 70's when an American missionary couple, Bill and Lil Tinsley, started a ministry to a small band of young people and campus students in the University Belt of Manila. The group was then known as the Jesus People (JP), an overflow of the worldwide Jesus People Movement catching fire among the young generation in Europe and America.

                        At the height of student activism, the Holy Spirit Fire broke out among these young people, setting their hearts ablaze with the passionate love for the Lord Jesus Christ - a passion more powerful than the ideology of communism, spirit of rebellion and new age philosophies prevalent in those years. Among the first fruits of this powerful move of God were the present elders of CLSF.

                        Through the 70's and early 80's, the JPs evolved into a Spirit-filled ministry. From a purely student ministry, the group began addressing the spiritual needs of the children, young couple, professionals and the elderly. They went through a season of testing that ushered them into a new beginning, a new name, a new grace and a new mandate. In 1982, the Lord gave the church a new name, Christ, the Living Stone Fellowship, based on Peter 4-51.

                        Embracing this new mandate, the CLSF began to embark on a church planting and missions work that saw our young leaders reach out to the provinces and began to establish churches in many towns and cities of the Philippines and even to the nations of the world. Today, CLSF has more than 200 churches and ministries in the Philippines and worldwide.

                        In recent years, God has raised up CLSF as a strong prophetic voice to the nation through its Senior Pastor Bishop Daniel A. Balais.
