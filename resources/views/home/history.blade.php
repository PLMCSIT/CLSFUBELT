                    <p>
                        After a Youth Camp in Batangas in 1988, a group of committed young men and women headed to the call that the Lord placed upon their hearts – to reach out to the young people. A weekly fervent prayer and fasting was held in a house at Tondo for this special call and what started as a series of seeking and waiting upon the Lord paved the way for the birth of the CLSF Youth Ministry. Finally, on July of the same year, the ministry was formally recognized.

                    <h3>The Vision: Presenting Every Youth Perfect in Christ</h3>
                    <p>
                        Conducting fellowship meetings and trainings at YMCA Manila (just behind Manila City Hall), CLSF Youth Ministry continued growing as the Lord faithfully guided the youth leaders in strategic ways of catering the younger generation. As majority if the members were from the academe, the leadership held special trainings for students to further the work of the Lord in their respective campuses, thus encouraging the vision of “presenting every youth perfect in Christ”. With increasing number of members, the Lord led the ministry to move to their new place at Extremadura, Sampaloc to hold their services and fellowships on Sundays while converting it as a Youth Center on weekdays.

                        In 1994, CLSF commenced the establishment of satellite churches all over Metro Manila and at this point, CLSF Youth Ministry is beginning to expand its territories as it starts to minister to young professionals as well. Not long after, the Youth Ministry enlarged its tent at the Lord’s direction to move to a more strategic place – at Cartimar Bldg., Recto Avenue in University Belt, hence, making the Youth Minitsry, now CLSF U-belt, a satellite church with Ptr. Bong Valencia as the Senior Pastor. The Lord began to disclose new strategies, and inspired them with a systematic means of reaching out to young people through cell group ministry. Additional campuses were opened. Leadership trainings were reinforced through School of Workers, Bible Training Class and Youth Leaders’ Camps. In 1997, the Campus Ministry was further strengthened. Summer Clinics were opened and held at the CLSF Central. Free classes for voice, guitar, bass, keyboard and dance lessons were opened to young people. “Sembreakthrough” camps were held and became an avenue of revitalizing young people from different CLSF Satellite Churches.

                        In July 1998, CLSF U-belt stretched its curtain wide all the more through the cell church system. A localized Cell Internship Program was conducted which made CLSF U-belt embark into a Cell Church. It was also on the same year that the whole Body of Christ called a National Youth gathering dubbed as “KKK” or Kristianong Kabataan para sa Kalayaan. CLSF U-belt worked with the youth body, and became actively involved in joining in one of our nation’s historical events.

                        In 1999, CLSF U-belt got more exposed to both local and international involvements such as Tribal Missions Philippines and International Cell Church Conference in Singapore. With the young people’s increasing desire for involvement, CLSF U-belt once more asked for the Lord’s wisdom on how to channel the youth’s energy and passion for His greater Glory. Thus YOUTH.COM was conceived in June and launched in August. Its prime objective was to make an avenue for the young people’s skills and talents to be used for God’s glory. It was also in this year that Ptr. Jun Turla took over as the Senior Pastor. In 2002, CLSF-UBELT spearheaded the camp for the whole CLSF Youth held at Jabez Campsite in Cavite, with its theme, “Let the River Flow”. Ardent young people carried on the fire as monthly Youth Convergence followed the said camp. Hundreds of young people were ministered and gave their life to Jesus during those activities.

                        In 2004, the Lord blessed CLSF-UBELT to move to its new home at Orient Pearl Building in Recto. After the 2000 elections, the whole body of Christ was called to pray and fast for the nationand with CLSF being actively involved, CLSF-UBELT eagerly participated. Fastings, dawn watches and even campus prayer meetings were started. Weekly prayer watches held at CLSF Calbayog were actively attended by members. This year, another milestone on the CLSF-UBELT history materialized as it gave birth to a Community Saturday/Sunday Services in San Lucas, Payatas. The Pua family hosts its weekly services at their own residence to minister to the families in the community. Indeed, we can never really limit our God! To date, the CLSF-UBELT has 153 members and has four main ministries – the Campus Ministry, Young Professionals Ministry, Couples Ministry and the Children’s Ministry faithfully advancing the Kingdom and giving the Lord all the glory He deserves.

                        “As CLSF fulfilled this commitment of fruit-bearing and embraced God’s prophetic purposes for our church, many souls had been added to His Kingdom.”
